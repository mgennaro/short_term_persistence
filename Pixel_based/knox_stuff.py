modified to work for the short time persistence project
(hence the suffix _spv, short-time persistence version)

def get_persistence_spv(model,exp=300.,dt=1000.):
    '''
    Calculate the persistence curve using the tabulated A_gamma model

    where:

    exp    the exposure of the stimulus image
    dt    the time since the stimulus image was taken
    models    the file containing times and links to the persitance
        curves

    We need to interpolate both for the actual stimulus and
    for the fact that we don't have a grid of exposures.

    This just returns the persistence curve (on a specific grid) for a given exposure
    time exp and delta time dt.

    Note:

    Although this was initially developed for a phenomenalogical model where an 
    amplitude and a power law index had be calculated but fitting observatonal data, 
    any model with includes a power law decay can be case in the from of the so-called
    A-gama model, including a fermi-type model.

    History:

    170331    gennaro This needs the model in input as dictionary

    140630    ksl    Added a variable models to allow one to read files in any directory
            of interest

def read_models_spv():

    Read in the fits models for which can be expressed

    Notes:

    The interpolated Fermi models are also read in 
    via this procedure.


    History

    170331  gennaro  made it return a dictionary and removed the test to see whether the function has been called
                     also: this only read the a-gama models by choice (and their path is hardcoded)
    140803    ksl    Coded
    140805    ksl    Replaced older read_models routine
