Project for the study of short term persistence in the WFC3 IR detector.
The data used are from the Calibration program 14016 (Knox & Bagget), which images Westerlund 1 while taking ~few arseconds dithers between exposures.
Darks follow the science exposures.

The AD_based folder contains code for an astrodrizzle based analysis. The pixel_based folder contains code for an approach based on detectors pixels (usinf either .flt, .ima, .raw files)
